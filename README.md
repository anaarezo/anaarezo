# ✨ Greetings, curious visitor!
Passionate about technology, I thrive on the ever-changing landscape of software development. My mission? To wield these advancements like a digital wizard, crafting an inclusive, seamless, and accessible web where knowledge flows as effortlessly as a perfectly brewed cup of tea. ☕️

With 15+ years of experience as a Software Engineer, I’ve navigated the wild seas of development, from the intricate vaults of financial institutions to the ever-bustling world of e-commerce. For over 10 years, I have meticulously analysed user behaviours, enhanced experiences, and devised cunning strategies to make interfaces as intuitive as instinct itself.

At present, I continue my journey into the realms of mobile app development—because why stop at websites when you can build entire experiences? I keep my tech toolkit sharp by constantly exploring the latest advancements, including AWS and Generative AI.
