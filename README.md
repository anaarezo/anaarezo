First and foremost, I am fascinated by technology!

I like investigating new ways to leverage software and technology development to increase the inclusion of people in the virtual world transmitting knowledge and information through the accessible web.

I have been front-end developer for 9 years exploring the information technology area and daily looking for new challenges. I am responsible for the development of online stores with 6 years of experience working in e-commerces of various segments and customers.
