I have been front-end developer for 9 years exploring the information technology area and daily looking for new challenges. I am responsible for the development of online stores with 6 years of experience working in e-commerces of various segments and customers.

I am fascinated by web accessibility (WCAG), which aims to include even more people in the digital world.

Feel free to start a dialogue and send me a message by [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anaarezo). I am always available to productive conversations about software development, design system, web accessibility and career in Information Technology.

❖ Core skills: Front-end development, web development, web accessibility, e-commerce, Scrum methodology (CSPO - Certified Scrum Product Owner®) and design system.
